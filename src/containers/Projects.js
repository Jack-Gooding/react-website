                This server controls: Philips Hue Lights, TP-Link Smart Plugs, several Arduino devices attached to: WS2812b RGB LED strips, Temperature/Humidity monitors, Stepper motors, along with several commercial products.
                It's currently hosted and visible on an AWS EC2 instance, however it is also currently running on a Raspberry Pi at my home.

                This project has been merged with my MQTT broker to replace many of the API calls within my home with MQTT messages. This greatly helps with maintenance and extensibility.
